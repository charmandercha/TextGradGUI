No problem, let's refine the description to reflect the `uv` project structure.

## textGradGUI: Textual Backpropagation with a User-Friendly Gradio Interface

This repository presents **textGrad**, a user-friendly Gradio application for **TextGrad**, a groundbreaking framework that implements automatic "differentiation" for textual gradients. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), TextGrad enables backpropagation through text feedback, bringing the familiar gradient metaphor to the world of natural language.

Our Gradio interface, "textGrad," makes this powerful functionality even more accessible. It allows users to interact with and experiment with TextGrad's core features in a simple, intuitive web-based environment. Whether you're optimizing answers to complex questions, refining code snippets, or fine-tuning prompts, "textGrad" provides a visual and interactive way to harness textual gradients.

### Key Features of TextGrad (integrated in this app):

* **Textual Gradient Descent (TGD):** Optimize various textual variables using LLM feedback, much like traditional gradient descent.
* **PyTorch-like API:** A familiar API for defining loss functions and optimizing parameters, making it easy for developers experienced with PyTorch to adapt.
* **Versatile Optimization:** Apply textual differentiation to a wide range of tasks, including:
    * Improving LLM-generated answers
    * Refining code snippets
    * Optimizing prompts for better LLM performance
    * And more!
* **Support for Diverse LLMs:** TextGrad, and by extension this application, supports a growing list of LLM backends (via `litellm`), including Bedrock, Together, Gemini, and others.

### What's New (with this Gradio App):

* **Interactive Web Interface:** "textGrad" provides a user-friendly Gradio interface, making it easier to experiment with TextGrad without diving deep into code.
* **Simplified Demonstrations:** Quickly see TextGrad in action with pre-configured examples directly within the Gradio app.
* **Enhanced Accessibility:** This visual tool offers a new way for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the potential of textual gradients.

### Quick Start: Running textGrad

This project utilizes `uv` for efficient dependency management and project setup. Follow these steps to get your "textGrad" application up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/textGrad-gradio-app.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
    cd textGrad-gradio-app
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the Gradio Application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    Once running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by Gradio (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

### Original TextGrad Project

This Gradio application is built upon the incredible work of the [Original TextGrad Project](https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad). We aim to make their powerful framework even more accessible to a wider audience.
